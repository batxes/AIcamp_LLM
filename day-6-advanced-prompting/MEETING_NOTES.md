# Exploring Advanced Prompting Techniques
By Subash Natarajan

## Agenda
1. Introduction to Prompt Engineering
   - Basics of prompt engineering
2. Prompting Formulas
   - Discussing different formulas and their usage
3. Techniques in Prompting
   - Demo included
4. Decoding Prompting Myths
   - Understanding common misconceptions
5. Future of Prompting
   - What lies ahead for prompt engineering

## Key Concepts
- **Prompt Engineering:** Art of communicating with AI or LLM (Large Language Models)
- **Prompting Levels:** Varies from basic to advanced; aim to improve AI responses
- **Advanced Prompting Techniques:**
  - Chain of Thought (COT)
  - Tree of Thoughts (TOT)
  - Self-Consistency

## Prompt Engineering Overview
- **Process:**
  - Provide a prompt → Pass through LLM → Generate text output
  - A wrong question can lead to inaccurate or "hallucinated" responses
- **Importance:**
  - Proper prompting is crucial for effective AI interactions
  - System, master, and structured prompts are essential for correct outputs

## How LLM Works
- Based on predictive text using a transformer model
- **Temperature Setting:**
  - Low temperature = more accuracy
  - High temperature = more creativity

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices
- Common misconception: Always following a set formula
- Key Components:
  - Role, Context, Task, Example, Format, Tone, and Goals
  - Context is the most critical component

## Advanced Prompting Techniques
1. **Chain of Thought (COT):**
   - Sequential, step-by-step guidance like a train trip
2. **Tree of Thoughts (TOT):**
   - Multiple pathways, like a road trip with crossroads
3. **Self-Consistency:**
   - Generate multiple responses and critiques for consistency

## Demo Highlights
- Demonstrated using a private GPT environment
- Different models can be run locally using Docker and Llama
- Show examples of simple vs. advanced prompting

## Prompting Mix and Myths
- Role prompting isn't always necessary
- Formula use isn't mandatory in every situation
- Longer prompts aren't always better
- Clear context and task understanding are crucial
