# OpenAI Introduction with Assistants

**Preface**

This guide will introduce you to using OpenAI and its powerful models, with a special focus on understanding and using OpenAI Assistants. You'll learn how to set up your environment, interact with the OpenAI API, and leverage the capabilities of Assistants for more complex tasks.

**Goals**

By the end of this guide, you should:

- Have working access to the OpenAI API.
- Understand the capabilities of OpenAI's models, including GPT-4 and others.
- Be able to make basic API calls.
- Understand how to create and use OpenAI Assistants.
- Begin experimenting with Assistants' tools and capabilities.

**Main Resources**

- **Required Accounts:**
  - OpenAI Account and API Key
- **Core Services:**
  - OpenAI API
  - OpenAI Assistants API
  - `openai` Python library
- **Development Tools:**
  - Python 3.7+ (ideally 3.9+)
  - Code Editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.) or Notebook environment

**Tasks**

- **OpenAI API Setup:**
  - Obtain an API key from your OpenAI account.
  -  Securely configure your API key (e.g., using environment variables or a .env file).
- **Basic Integration:**
  - Install the `openai` Python package
  - Configure API key
- **OpenAI Exploration:**
  - Understand model capabilities (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
  - Make basic API calls for text generation.
- **OpenAI Assistants Introduction:**
  - Understand the concept of OpenAI Assistants.
  - Create and configure a basic Assistant.
  - Begin experimenting with Assistant capabilities.

## Instructions

- **Sign up on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)**
- **API Key Management:**
  - Obtain your API key from the OpenAI website.
  - Do not share your API key. Keep it securely stored.

**Environment Setup**

- **Code:**
  - Recommended to import the GitHub repository in your [IDX environment](https://idx.google.com/import?url=https://github.com/aicampg/aisg-7-day-aiimmersion)
  - Ensure `requirements.txt` (or similar) is installed containing the openai library
  - Run the code and explore.
    -  Remember to handle your API key carefully.

**Helpful Tips**

- **Keep your API key secure.** Do not commit it to any public repository or share it in code.
- **Monitor your API usage:**  Be aware of your spending limits and API usage to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Start with small requests:** Begin with smaller requests to understand the models' behavior before processing larger, more complex tasks.
- **Review error messages:** Pay close attention to any errors and consult the documentation for troubleshooting.
- **Experiment with prompt engineering:**  Learn how to effectively craft prompts for the desired outputs.
- **Explore Assistants' tools:**  Investigate the available tools like Code Interpreter, File Retrieval and Function calling, to maximize the capabilities of Assistants.
- **Use threads:** Threads are the containers for conversations with Assistants. They also allow you to preserve the history of a conversation.
